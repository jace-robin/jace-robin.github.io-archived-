                        <li>I aspire to one day become a full time software programmer, either indie or with a company.</li>
                        <li>My dream college is Full Sail University in Florida, but more than likely I will go to a trade school to start my career.</li>
                        <li>At the moment, I'm only in 11th grade, but i hope to bring my grades up so that I can obtain scholarships and make my parents proud.</li>
                        <li>I should probably stop typing this right now, its turning more into a journal than anything, sad music does that to me I guess.</li>
